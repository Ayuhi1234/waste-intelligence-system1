## 👨‍💻 Intern Onboarding & Management (Part C)
I have designed a **5-Day "Day 1 Delivery" Sprint** to onboard interns immediately. The goal is to ship a working "Hello World" feature by the end of Week 1 to build confidence.

**Core Philosophy:**
* **Frontend:** Use component libraries to skip CSS struggles; focus on data integration.
* **Machine Learning:** Start with mock data; ship a simple heuristic model before deep learning.
* **Code Reviews:** Focus on teaching patterns (e.g., avoiding N+1 queries) rather than nitpicking syntax.
